# VRUnited_Builds

# Install

1. Download the latest build from the [Releases](https://github.com/eventlab-projects/VRUnited_Builds/releases) section. 
2. Uncompress the __Builds.rar__ file. You will see that a folder for each supported platform is generated. Select the build that matches your system requirements:
* __Quest__: It contains a compatible .apk for _Oculus Quest (1/2)_. You must enable the developer mode on your _Quest_ (see [here](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/)). Then you must sideload the .apk on your device using [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto) (recommended, see Appendix A) or by directly using the corresponding adb commands through the console.
* __Pico__: sideload the .apk on your device using [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto) (recommended, see Appendix A) or by directly using the corresponding adb commands through the console. No further action is required as _Pico_ devices already have the developer mode enabled.
* __PC_Oculus__: This build works with the following devices: Oculus Rift family, Oculus Quest (1/2) + Link. You need to install the [Oculus software](https://www.oculus.com/setup/) on your computer.
* __PC_SteamVR__: This build works with any platform supporting SteamVR, which includes (but not limited to) HTC Vive (Pro), Valve Index as well as all the platforms in PC_Oculus. It is necessary to install [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) in your PC, as well as the [SteamVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/) application.

If you donâ€™t have an HMD, you also can use the VRUnited application as a normal desktop application by using either the __PC_Oculus__ or __PC_SteamVR__ executables. In that case, __no additional software is required__, so simply start the executable.

Also take into consideration that, if you are running the application through the PC (with VR support or not), you need to make sure beforehand that your microphone is correctly detected as the default audio input device, that is properly working and that your applications are allowed to access to the microphone.

Finally, for future releases, probably the PC_Oculus build will be deprecated, as all the platforms supported by PC_Oculus are already supported by PC_SteamVR. So it is convenient you start installing the Steam and SteamVR if you want to keep using VRUnited on desktop with VR support.
